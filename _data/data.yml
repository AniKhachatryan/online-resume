          location: New York, NY
          details: |
            + Worked with and analyzed scRNA-seq and neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene data
            + Proved the hypothesis that highly expressed RBP-regulated genes are more likely to be risk genes of neurodevelopmental disorders

        - role: Data Scientist
          time: 2018.04 - 2018.09
          company: Synopsys Armenia CJSC

          location: Yerevan, Armenia
          details: |
            + Used the mutual information (MI) metric to find co-evolving sites in protein multiple sequence alignments
            + Demonstrated as a proof-of-concept that co-evolving sites can be used to guide the search for compensational mutations for cancer, thus reducing wet lab costs
            + Was evaluated as “Excellent” at the end of the internship by my supervisor
